## Please answer these questions

### What is one thing that has surprised you so far in Cardiff?

One thing that has surprised me in Cardiff is how much American culture/influence is present around the city. Specifically at the bars and nightclubs people seem to play American music, especially American rap. In my finance class, the American financial system is frequently mentioned and the USD is used as a comparison currency. Interestingly, I have seen many food restaurants that market "California tacos'' along with other "west coast" foods. Despite the American influence the United Kingdom has a lot of little things that definitely take getting used to. Specifically, I was surprised by the fact that eggs aren't refrigerated and that you have to show a valid ID to buy cutlery. Overall I was surprised by how similar society is here once I got used to the cultural differences present within everyday life.

### What are three things that you hope to get out of your study abroad experience this semester?

The first major thing I want to get out of this study abroad is experiencing and successfully adapting to a new culture/lifestyle. I feel that making friends and completing a successful academic semester in another country will give me invaluable experience for my life within the United States. The second thing that I am hoping to get out of this study abroad is traveling and experiencing a lot of new places within Europe. The third major thing I want to get out of this study abroad is experiencing new culture through friends that I meet in the city.

## Feedback

Lots of interesting observations you've made.  I'm glad you're getting out and experiencing so much just over the first couple weeks!
